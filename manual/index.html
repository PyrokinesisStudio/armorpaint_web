**ArmorPaint / Manual**

# Intro

![](img/title.jpg)

*The following is an in-progress(!) quick start guide*

ArmorPaint is a stand-alone tool fully specialized in physically based texture painting of 3D models. Import desired geometry and start painting right away. A modern viewport provides instant visual feedback as you paint.

# Download

Runs on **Windows, Linux and MacOS**.

- [Get ArmorPaint](http://armorpaint.org/download.html)

## Requirements

As of now ArmorPaint is known to work on Intel HD5100 graphics card. For 8K/16K texture painting, GTX 1060/6GB or better is recommended.

## Limitations

Only the absolute basics are working. There is no undo, masking or layers yet. As the time goes, these issues will get resolved.

## Controls

`Left mouse button` to paint. `Right mouse button` to rotate the mesh. `Mouse wheel` to zoom in and out.

# Assets

## Import Meshes

Drag and drop unwrapped `.obj` file into the viewport. This will replace the currently painted mesh. Importing `.blend` and `.fbx` formats is in progress but not yet supported. Use Blender to do the conversion in the meantime.

## Import Materials

Importing Cycles materials from `.blend` format is in progress but not yet supported. Assemble materials in the built-in node editor for now.

## Import Textures

Drag and drop `.jpg` or `.png` images into the node editor. This will import the image and create a new Image node.

## Export Textures

Click `Project - Export Textures`. Format, resolution and channels to export can be configured in `Project - Properties`.

# Materials

Material nodes in ArmorPaint are based on Cycles nodes. When painting, brush applies a material onto the surface. To setup material, invoke node editor with `Project - Material - Edit`. Use toolbar at the top to add new nodes. Use `x` shortcut do delete existing nodes.

# Painting

Configure brush parameters in `Project - Brush`. `Left mouse button` to paint.
