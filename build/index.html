		<h1>PBR Texture Painting</h1>
		<p>ArmorPaint is an <b>in-development</b> tool fully specialized in physically based texture painting of 3D models. <b>Simplicity is beauty</b> - import desired geometry and start painting right away. A modern viewport provides <b>instant visual feedback</b> as you paint.</p>
		<p>With seamless texture export, ArmorPaint is a handy companion ready to work with <b>PBR-capable engines</b> such as Armory, Unreal, Unity, Cycles..</p>

		<h1>Node Based</h1>
		<p>Work fast with the convenience of nodes. ArmorPaint uses a subset of standard <b>material nodes</b> found in <b>Cycles render engine</b>. This enables you to paint with complex, fully procedural materials using the proven workflow. Apart from materials, <b>brush nodes</b> are used to easily create painting patterns, shapes and procedural brushes.</p>

		<h1>GPU Accelerated</h1>
		<p>Performance is priority - modern graphics cards are capable of insane output. ArmorPaint is designed from scratch to run <b>completely on the GPU</b>. This results in a smooth 4K painting experience even on a medium-power integrated hardware. On the other hand, up to <b>20K texture painting</b> is seamless using a high-end graphics card - ready to help you produce content presented on 4K HDR displays.</p>

		<h1>Super Portable</h1>
		<p>Paint on a device that makes you work the best. ArmorPaint is built on a modern, <b>portable technology</b> and runs across <b>Windows, Linux and MacOS</b>. Virtual reality, iOS, Android and web support is currently in experimental stage. Program distribution itself is also portable, with no installation procedure or copy protection.</p>

		<h1>Armory Engine</h1>
		<p>ArmorPaint takes advantage of a <b>render engine</b> found in the Armory project. Armory is a real-time engine allowing you to <b>create games and interactive visualizations</b> with full Blender integration. The internals of Armory and ArmorPaint are tightly shared meaning that every improvement to one project also benefits the other one.</p>
